# Notes
Part proof of concept, part test app. 
The idea of this was to have a place to test new functionality on a simple application.
It stated with a very basic requeriment, to manage simple notes.(List them, add them, delete them) And the idea is to use this to test libraries, code or ways to implement something without having to worry on a complex business requeriment.

Functionality:
For now it just adds,modifies, deletes notes using Android Architecture Components
